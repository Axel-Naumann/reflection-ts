This Technical Specification describes extensions to the \Cpp Programming
Language (Clause \ref{intro.refs}) that enable operations on source code. These
extensions include new syntactic forms and modifications to existing language
semantics, as well as changes and additions to the existing library facilities.

The International Standard, ISO/IEC 14882, provides important context and
specification for this Technical Specification.  This document is written as a
set of changes against that specification.  Instructions to modify or add
paragraphs are written as explicit instructions.  Modifications made directly to
existing text from the International Standard use \added{underlining} to
represent added text and \removed{strikethrough} to represent deleted text.
